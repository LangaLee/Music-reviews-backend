    body: "So my friend rigby kept talking about how JID is an amaizing artist so I decided to give him a chance and listen to his work. Listing to the forever story was amazing and I can't recommend this album enough. His wordplay is beyond amazing, the flows on each song are out of this world and The story telling is really well done. If I had to give this a score I would give it a 10/10.",
